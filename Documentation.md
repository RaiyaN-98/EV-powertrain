# Designing Electric Vehicle Powertrain Using Matlab/Simulink Platform
## Overview and key terms:
For being ecofriendly and driven by renewable energies Electric Vehicle (EV) is becoming very popular day by day. 
Before constructing a practical vehicle, modeling and simulating the design is very important to find out the pros and
cons of the design. In this project modeling of a simple EV powertrain is made and how the vehicle drive can be 
improved by using a higher rated motor is shown. A block diagram representing the modeling in brief shown below:
